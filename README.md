# Using Plupload To Upload Files In AngularJS

by [Ben Nadel][bennadel] (on [Google+][googleplus])

I use [Plupload][plupload] a lot. It's really an amazing file-upload tool that supports all kinds
off cool stuff like multiple dropzones and client-size rendering. I really can't give it enough
praise - it's just totally awesome. I also use [AngularJS][angularjs] a lot, which is outstanding
JavaScript framework. But, I haven't really done anything all that interesting with them together.
Sure, I've used Plupload inside AngularJS before; but, I've never done anything with multiple 
dropzones. As such, I figured I better start experimenting.

This project isn't about any one thing in particular. I just wanted to get more comfortable with 
using Plupload in AngularJS so that I could start to think about how I wanted to refine my 
approach. Which is to say, this project doesn't necessarily reflect the most refined approach -
it's simply what I got working.
